# Regression-Project

In this regression project, we'll work with the dataset `canada_rent.csv` containing rental prices for units in across Canada in 2024.
Dataset obtained from [rentfaster.ca](https://www.rentfaster.ca/?utm_source=OOH&utm_medium=sign&utm_campaign=ca).

My goal is to explore multiple regression models, in order to find a model that predicts the rental price most accurately.

To do this, I will:
1. Read and explore the data
- Load data into df
- Basic EDA to see potential issues and important features

2. Clean and prepare the data
- Deal with missing values
- Convert categorical columns into numerical format
- Select revelant features

3. Compare different regression models
- Linear Regression
- Ridge model
- LassoCv model

4. Choose the best model and make predictions on provided input.
  According to error metrics obtained, LaasoCv performs better and is used to make predictions on input that I provide.
